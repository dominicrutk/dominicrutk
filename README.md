My name is Dominic Rutkowski, and I am a rising senior studying computer science and mathematics at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). I am interested in the theory, systems, and implementation of software that deals with large amounts of data. I am on track to graduate in December 2024, and after that, I aspire to work as a software engineer.
